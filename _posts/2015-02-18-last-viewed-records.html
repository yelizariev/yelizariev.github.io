SugarCRM shows last viewed records. Why not do the same in odoo? So, I did.
</p>

It allows easily navigate to recently pages.
</p>
<p>
For non-form view there is icon for type of view at the end of label.
</p>
<p>
For some models (e.g. Partner, Opportunity etc) special icon is shown.
</p>
<p>
This module doesn't affect on server performance, because it uses
browser's localStorage to save history. But, of course, it means that
history is not synced accross browsers.
</p>
<p>
Currently, very simple behavior is used:
</p>
<ul>
<li>New history item is added to first position only if it is not in
   history list
</li>
<li>Last history item is removed if there are more than 8 items already.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Also, this module can be helpful for developers, because
everytime you will have quick access to module page to install updates and access
to page where you want to test something.
