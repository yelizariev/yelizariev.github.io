<p>
Odoo has a good integration with email. It allows to have a discussion
with a customer attached to some record (task, lead, invoice etc.).
</p>

<p>
In the main, your customer don't know about this and can send emails
(e.g. about a task) to your personal alias
(e.g. admin@yourcompany). It could not be a problem, if you work on
task alone. But if you need to share email to colleagues, it's better
to move (attach) mail to task form. I've made module
<code>mail_move_message</code> to do it.
</p>

<p>
Technically, the module update fields <code>res_id</code> and <code>model</code> of
<code>mail.message</code> modules. It also, keep original values to allow to move
everything back.

A usage guide with screenshots can be found here: <a href="https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/8.0/mail_move_message/">https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/8.0/mail_move_message/</a>
</p>

<p>
It's not mentioned in module's description, but if you move a message,
then all messages in a thread below the message would also be moved
to a new location.
