In odoo 8.0 new smart buttons were introduced:
</p>
<img class="rounded shadow border" src="/images/odoo/module/res_partner_company.png"/>

<p>
Some users expects, that in a company's form these buttons will search
information about tasks, invoices, meetings etc. for whole company. 
But out-of-box buttons work only with records that are attached to
company and not to company's contacts.
</p>

<p>
I have made module <code>res_partner_company_stat</code> to fix this issue.
E.g. in "Calls" smart button you will get calls both for company and for
company's contacts.

Another issue is search in contacts. With my module <code>res_partner_company_search</code> contacts are searched by company's fields also. E.g.  you search contacts with a tag "Veterinary" and you get "child1" even if it doesn't have this tag, because his company does.

(Out-of-box you will get in search results parent2 and child2 only).
