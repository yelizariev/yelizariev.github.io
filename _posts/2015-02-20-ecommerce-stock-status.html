<p>
Unfortunately, odoo doesn't consider stock status of a products in
eCommerce and customers are able to  order out-of-stock items.
</p>
<p>
But on the other hand, the strength of the odoo is module structure to
make modifications easily.
</p>
<p>
So, I've made a small module <code>website_sale_stock_status</code> to fix this issue.
</p>


<img class="rounded shadow border" src="/images/odoo/module/website_sale_stock_status.png"/>

<p>
The module adds automatic ribbons:
</p><ul>
<li>DISCONTINUED &ndash;  stock is 0 and the status is End of Life or Obsolete.
</li>
<li>BACKORDERED &ndash; stock is 0 and the status is Normal,
</li>
</ul>


<p>
It also puts ribbons text at the product page and disables "Add to
cart" feature if product is discontinued.
</p>

<p>
By default, stock status is updated every hour. It can be changed at
Settings/Technical/Automation/Scheduled Actions
