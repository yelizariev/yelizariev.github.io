To install odoo on debian or ubuntu system connect to your server via
ssh and execute commands  step-by-step from ~install-odoo.sh~ file of this gist:

It covers following aspects:
 * Installation of a stable odoo version. Odoo will start automatically after rebooting server. 
 * Longpolling support (for instant messaging inside odoo)
 * Autobackup with backups rotating (to save a disk space)
 * Nginx port forwarding (to avoid addresses with a port like this: http://example.com:8069/ )
 * Multitenancy support (you can create any number databases on a single installation)
