<p>
This site is about my works in odoo. 
</p>
<p>
Most of my modules I've made for my customers or for myself. I
realised soon, that these modules can be helpfull for other
people. So, I started this blog and I spend some time to provide
illustrated description for modules, which is actually not needed neither for
me nor for my customers.
</p>
<p>
All my modules are opensource*. But if you like to support my efforts
you are welcome to pay for any of my modules in store:
