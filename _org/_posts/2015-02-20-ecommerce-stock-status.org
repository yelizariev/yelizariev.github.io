Unfortunately, odoo doesn't consider stock status of a products in
eCommerce and customers are able to  order out-of-stock items.

But on the other hand, the strength of the odoo is module structure to
make modifications easily.

So, I've made a small module ~website_sale_stock_status~ to fix this issue.

#+BEGIN_HTML
<img class="rounded shadow border" src="/images/odoo/module/website_sale_stock_status.png"/>
#+END_HTML

The module adds automatic ribbons:
 * DISCONTINUED --  stock is 0 and the status is End of Life or Obsolete.
 * BACKORDERED -- stock is 0 and the status is Normal,

It also puts ribbons text at the product page and disables "Add to
cart" future if product is discontinued.

#+BEGIN_HTML
<img class="rounded shadow border" src="/images/odoo/module/website_sale_stock_status2.png"/>
#+END_HTML

By default, stock status is updated every hour. It can be changed at
Settings/Technical/Automation/Scheduled Actions
